# Assembling the circuit
Assemble the circuit as shown in the pictures. 
- Port 10 is connected to the servo's PWM input.
- The other pins of the servo are connected to the +5V supply of the Arduino, and, the common ground
- Port 3 and 4 are connected to the white and red LEDs respectively, and their negative terminals are connected to the common ground through the resistor
