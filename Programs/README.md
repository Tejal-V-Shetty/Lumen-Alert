# Reconfiguration
In the context of the Python code, some reconfiguration may be necessary when run on different devices :
- The URL for the IP Webcam access must be copied from the application itself. It is visible on the screen on starting a live feed server.
- The COM port for serial communication must be copied from the Arduino IDE
